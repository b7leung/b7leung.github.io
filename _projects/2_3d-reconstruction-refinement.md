This project proposes a novel neural network **refinement algorithm and paradigm to improve 3D mesh reconstructions** from any single-view reconstruction method. This is done by using **self-supervised learning** to exploit the silhouette of the input image, encouraging consistency between the mesh and the given object view by differentiable 3D rendering. In addition, several **symmetry** based losses are introduced to regularize the refinement. The use of the refinement at test time **beats state-of-the-art (up to 47%), across many datasets, metrics, and object classes**. The refinement step that can be easily integrated into the pipeline of any black-box method in the literature. Python, PyTorch, and PyTorch 3D are extensively used. For more details, please refer to the [full paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09911.pdf).
