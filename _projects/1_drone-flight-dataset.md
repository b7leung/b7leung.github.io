title: "Drone Flight Dataset for Neural Network Classification Robustness"
excerpt: "📅 **Sep. 2018 - Present** <br/> Developed a drone flight system to collect over 120,000 images. The dataset was used to conduct experiments showing severe vulnerabilities (30% drop) in neural networks to pose & camera shake. Findings published to CVPR 2019.

The hypothesis that image datasets gathered online “in the wild“ can produce biased object recognizers, e.g. preferring professional photography or certain viewing angles, is studied. A new “in the lab“ data collection infrastructure is proposed consisting of a drone which captures images as it circles around objects. It's inexpensive and easily replicable nature may also potentially lead to a scalable data collection effort by the vision community. The procedure's usefulness is demonstrated by creating a dataset of Objects Obtained With fLight (OOWL). Currently, OOWL contains 120,000 images of 500 objects and is the largest “in the lab“ image dataset available when both number of classeds and objects per class are considered.
