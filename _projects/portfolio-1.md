title: "Drone Flight Dataset for Neural Network Classification Vulnerabilities"
excerpt: "Published to CVPR 2019. Developed a novel drone flight system to collect over 120,000 images. Conducted experiments to show show severe vulnerabilities (30% drop) in neural networks like ResNet to pose & camera shake. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

The hypothesis that image datasets gathered online “in the wild“ can produce biased object recognizers, e.g. preferring professional photography or certain viewing angles, is studied. A new “in the lab“ data collection infrastructure is proposed consisting of a drone which captures images as it circles around objects. It's inexpensive and easily replicable nature may also potentially lead to a scalable data collection effort by the vision community. The procedure's usefulness is demonstrated by creating a dataset of Objects Obtained With fLight (OOWL). Currently, OOWL contains 120,000 images of 500 objects and is the largest “in the lab“ image dataset available when both number of classes and objects per class are considered.
