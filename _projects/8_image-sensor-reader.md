In this project, I developed a suite of tools using Java to **analyze image sensor quality**. The tools were for [Himax Imaging](https://www.himax.com.tw/), an R&D/fabrication company specializing in CMOS image sensors used in smartphone cameras and car backup cameras. The program depicts the **sensorsâ€™ silicon wafer** with indications of areas with the most unstable sensor chips. Also provides functions like **history recording, re/undo, statistics calculation, pixel editing, and image transformations**, behind a user-friendly GUI.
