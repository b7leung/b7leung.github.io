The hypothesis that image datasets gathered online â€œin the wildâ€œ can produce biased object recognizers, e.g. preferring professional photography or certain viewing angles, is studied. A new â€œin the labâ€œ data collection infrastructure is proposed consisting of a drone which captures images as it circles around objects. It's inexpensive and easily replicable nature may also potentially lead to a scalable data collection effort by the vision community. The procedure's usefulness is demonstrated by creating a dataset of Objects Obtained With fLight (OOWL). Currently, OOWL contains 120,000 images of 500 objects and is the largest â€œin the labâ€œ image dataset available when both number of classeds and objects per class are considered.
