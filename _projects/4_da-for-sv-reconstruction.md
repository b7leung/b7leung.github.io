Deep learning-based object reconstruction algorithms
have shown remarkable improvements over classical methods. However, supervised learning based methods perform
poorly when the training data and the test data have different distributions. Indeed, most current works perform
satisfactorily on the synthetic ShapeNet dataset, but dramatically fail in when presented with real world images. To
address this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation can be
used transfer knowledge from the label
