This project studies two **reinforcement learning** algorithms: **Q-learning** and **Monte-Carlo policy iteration**. These techniques are applied to a two-player game called **Connect Four**, which is a game similar to tic-tac-toe, in order to learn a policy which will allow an AI agent to play the game at a high level. The game is formally described as a **Markv decision process** (MDP), and the RL algorithms are applied to it. This includes the generation of episodes using **self-play**, used to update the policy. The final results are presented qualitatively and quantitatively on a variety of different opponents. Insight is also given into the effect of various parameters, finishing with recommendation on which are the most beneficial. For details, please refer to the [report](https://b7leung.github.io/files/Connect%20Four.pdf).
