In this project, we focus on studying two classical reinforcement learning algorithms: Q-learning and Monte-Carlo
policy iteration. These techniques are applied to a two-player game called Connect Four, which is a game similar
to tic-tac-toe, in order to learn a policy which will allow an AI agent to play the game at a high level. In Section 2,
we formally describe the game as an MDP. Then, in Section 3 we describe our RL algorithms and how it can be
applied to the MDP formulation. This includes the generation of episodes using self-play, which we will use to
update our policy. Finally, in Section 4 the final results are presented on a variety of different opponents. We also
give some insight into the affect of various parameters and give some visualizations of the results.
