Hi! I'm 2nd year Masters student majoring in Machine Learning and Data Science at UC San Diego, expecting to graduate in December 2021. I have researched computer vision at the [Statistical Visual Computing Laboratory]() under Professor Nuno Vasconcelos for 4 years. I'm especially passionate about applying ML/AI research towards solving challenging real-world problems. 


In my research, I have focused on various topics, including 2D/3D detection, domain adaptation, GANs, 3D reconstruction, embeddings, self-supervised learning, and explainable neural networks. For details, please see the [projects page]() and [publications page]().  

Previously, I earned a Bachelors (Magna Cum Laude) from UC San Diego in Computer Science. More details can be found in my [resume here](), and my [CV here]().
