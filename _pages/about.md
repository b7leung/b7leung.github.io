Hi! I'm 2nd year Masters student majoring in Machine Learning and Data Science at UC San Diego, expecting to graduate in December 2021. I have researched computer vision at the [Statistical Visual Computing Laboratory](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/) under Professor Nuno Vasconcelos for 4 years. I'm especially passionate about combining applied ML/AI research and software engineering towards solving challenging real-world problems. 

In my research, I have focused on various topics including 2D/3D detection, domain adaptation, autonomous vehicle navagation, GANs, 3D reconstruction, embeddings, self-supervised learning, and explainable neural networks. For details, please see the [projects page](https://b7leung.github.io/projects/) and [publications page](https://b7leung.github.io/publications/).  

Previously, I earned a Bachelors degree from UC San Diego in Computer Science. More details can be found in my [resume](https://b7leung.github.io/files/Resume_Brandon_Leung.pdf), and my [CV]().
