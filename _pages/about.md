About Me
======

Hi! I train & ship **3D visual perception models** at Tesla. These models are at the core of many cool Tesla products, including [Autopilot/FSD](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot), [High-Fidelity Park Assist](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1743701415208403092), [Vision Autopark](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_us/GUID-0C763E08-D0B8-4404-8180-1054F635C08C.html), and [Actually Smart Summon](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1838182067269497140). My main engineering & research interests include **computer vision foundation models, generative modeling, 3D scene understanding, and vision-language models**.

Previously, I researched computer vision & deep learning at the [Statistical Visual Computing Lab](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/) for 5 years. I published several papers to CVPR/CVPRW; topics include 3D reconstruction, 2D/3D detection, domain adaptation, self-supervised learning. For details, see the [projects page](https://b7leung.github.io/projects/).

I earned my Masters degree in Machine Learning and Data Science at UC San Diego. More details about my background can be found in my [resume](https://b7leung.github.io/files/Resume_Brandon_Leung.pdf).

I also developed & maintain **[a set of 250+ ML Flashcards](https://github.com/b7leung/MLE-Flashcards)**, covering computer science, classical ML, modern deep learning, 2D/3D computer vision, NLP, & reinforcement learning. This has been relatively popular & useful for others -- free to check it out for reference or study!
