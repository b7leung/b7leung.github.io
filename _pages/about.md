About Me
======

Hi! I train & ship 3D visual perception models at Tesla Autopilot. These models are at the core of many cool Tesla products that customers enjoy every day, including [Autopilot/FSD](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot), [High-Fidelity Park Assist](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1743701415208403092), [Vision Autopark](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_us/GUID-0C763E08-D0B8-4404-8180-1054F635C08C.html), and [Actually Smart Summon](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1838182067269497140).

Before that, I researched computer vision at the [Statistical Visual Computing Lab](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/) for 5 years. I published several papers to CVPR/CVPRW; areas of interest include 3D reconstruction, 2D/3D detection, domain adaptation, & self-supervised learning. For details, please see the [projects page](https://b7leung.github.io/projects/).

I earned my Masters degree in Machine Learning and Data Science at UC San Diego. More details about my background can be found in my [resume](https://b7leung.github.io/files/Resume_Brandon_Leung.pdf).
