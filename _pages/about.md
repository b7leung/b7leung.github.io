About Me
======
Hi! I recently obtained a Masters in Machine Learning and Data Science at UC San Diego, April 2022. I have been researching computer vision at the [Statistical Visual Computing Laboratory](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/) for 5 years. My passion is applying software engineering to cutting-edge ML/AI research, towards solving challenging real-world problems. 

In my research, I have focused on various topics including 2D/3D detection, domain adaptation, autonomous vehicle navigation, GANs, 3D reconstruction, embeddings, self-supervised learning, efficient ML, and explainable ML. For details, please see the [projects page](https://b7leung.github.io/projects/).

Previously, I earned a Bachelors degree from UC San Diego in Computer Science. More details can be found in my [resume](https://b7leung.github.io/files/Resume_Brandon_Leung.pdf).
